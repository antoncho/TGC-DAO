# 🛠️ The Top 5 ERP Fixes to Save Your Series B (or C)

For emerging tech companies, ERP is no longer a back-office afterthought. It’s your nervous system.  
If it’s not aligned, you’re not scaling — you’re escalating chaos.

## 📉 1. Stop the Spreadsheet Spiral  
If your team is working around the ERP in Excel, not inside it, you’ve already lost trust.  
Automate the essentials. Rebuild confidence with real-time visibility.

## 🔀 2. Rethink 'One System to Rule Them All'  
You don’t need a monolith. You need an orchestrator.  
Modern ERP must plug into your finance, CRM, and product stack — not replace them.

## 🧩 3. Integrate Ops Early  
Too many scaleups implement ERP *after* the chaos.  
Map your value chain. Integrate logic early. Save cash and sanity.

## 📊 4. Make Data Reliable — or Don’t Bother  
ERP is only as good as the data behind it.  
Dirty data → misinformed dashboards → investor drama.

## 🤝 5. Involve the Right People (Early)  
ERP failure is rarely about software. It’s leadership misalignment.  
Embed a transformation lead with *authority*, not just responsibility.
